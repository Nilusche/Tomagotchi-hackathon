## Problem
Many townish Folks don't have the necessary Know How or facilities to grow their own Food in a garden.<br>
While we were discussing, we identified a great lack of a great concept to teach or learn about gardening without overindulging yourself in blogposts or other means of information. <br>
We need something to engage the user to learn with a different approach. <br>

## Solution
We created an App that, just like with a real Tamagotchi, you learn how to grow your own virtual plant. <br>
In doing so you can connect with friends and compete with other players.<br>
Additionally we use flashcards to use the very technique of learning "Active Recall and Spaced Repetition" so the user can actually learn effortless.<br>

## Further Development Possibilities
Right now we do not have the right Tomatoplant-Facts or the possibility to grow other plants.<br>
The UI could be reworked too and other functionalities like a way to view blogposts could be added too.<br>
