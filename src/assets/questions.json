        "question": "What do i do when my tomatoes are yellowing?",
        "answer": "If you have some yellowing leaves on your tomato, don't panic. It may just be the normal maturing of the plant. As the plant gets older and finishes up fruiting, lower leaves may yellow because they are not taking up enough nutrients or they arenâ€™t getting enough sun. A lack of nitrogen in the soil may also result in yellowing./"
